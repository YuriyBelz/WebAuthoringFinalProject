things that we would need for the website:
thumbnails for the books
detail images for the books
image or video for the about page
genric picture for the jobs page


i was thinking that we should just make like 3 different books in 3 different genres
the genres could be sci-fi, mystery, and nonfiction
i was thinking i could just make the different images to the specific diesions we need in photoshop
we would need images to make the homepage and other pages interesting like on the javajam sites
i looked at the barnes and noble website as an example for what we should make the site look like
it just had pictures of books on the homepage and i was thinking we could copy that, i kind of made it look like it in the wireframe
